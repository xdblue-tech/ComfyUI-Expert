description: Build identity-preserving character generation workflows and pipelines in ComfyUI. Selects the optimal identity method (InfiniteYou, FLUX Kontext, PuLID, InstantID, IP-Adapter) based on use case requirements. Handles face preservation, likeness transfer, cross-domain conversion (3D to photo), multi-reference consistency, iterative character editing, and character variation generation. Triggers on requests to generate consistent characters, preserve identity across images, create face-swapping workflows, or convert 3D renders to photorealistic portraits. Does NOT cover general image generation without identity preservation, model training/LoRA fine-tuning, animation, technical explanations, or workflow debugging.

# ComfyUI Character Generation Expert

Build production-ready ComfyUI workflows for consistent character generation across image, video, and voice modalities.

## Quick Decision: Which Approach?

**Starting from reference images (like 3D renders)?**
→ **InfiniteYou** (state-of-the-art 2025) or InstantID + IP-Adapter (proven, lower VRAM)

**Need highest identity fidelity?**
→ **FLUX.2** (NEW 2026: up to 10 ref images) or **PuLID Flux II** (no model pollution)

**Want iterative editing without retraining?**
→ **FLUX Kontext** (context-aware, maintains consistency across edits)

**Creating video content?**
→ **LTX-2** (NEW 2026: 4K production-ready), **Wan 2.2 MoE** (film-level), or **FramePack** (60-sec on 6GB!)

**Need voice for character?**
→ **TTS Audio Suite** (unified platform, 23 languages) or **F5-TTS Cross-Lingual** (NEW 2026)

## Core Workflow Patterns

### Pattern 1: Zero-Shot Character Generation (No Training)

Best for: Quick iteration, 3D-to-photorealism conversion, limited reference images

```
Load Reference Face → InstantID + IP-Adapter FaceID → ControlNet Pose → KSampler → FaceDetailer → Upscale
```

**Critical settings:**

- CFG: 4-5 (prevents burning with InstantID)
- Resolution: 1016×1016 (avoids watermark artifacts)
- IP-Adapter weight: 0.6-0.8
- InstantID noise injection: 35% to negative

See `references/workflows.md` for complete node configurations.

### Pattern 2: LoRA + Identity Methods (Maximum Consistency)

Best for: Production work, character series, video generation base

```
Train LoRA → Load LoRA + Checkpoint → Add InstantID/PuLID → Generate → FaceDetailer → ReActor (optional) → Upscale
```

**Training requirements:**

- 15-30 images, varied poses/expressions/lighting
- Unique trigger word (e.g., "sage_character")
- See `references/lora-training.md` for full parameters

### Pattern 3: Video Generation Pipeline

Best for: Talking heads, character animation, promotional content

```
Generate/Load Hero Image → Wan 2.1 I2V OR AnimateDiff → FaceDetailer per frame → Frame Interpolation → Video Combine
```

**Model selection:**

- Wan 2.1 14B: Best quality, 24GB+ VRAM, slower
- Wan 2.1 1.3B: 8GB VRAM, good quality, faster
- AnimateDiff Lightning: Fastest, best for iteration

### Pattern 4: Talking Head with Voice

Best for: Character dialogue, presentations, social content

**Two approaches available:**

```
Approach 1 (Image → Talking Head):
Character Portrait → Generate Audio → SadTalker/LivePortrait → CodeFormer Enhancement → Final Video

Approach 2 (Video → Add Voice):
Existing Video → Generate Audio → Wav2Lip Lip-Sync → CodeFormer Enhancement → Final Video
```

See `references/talking-head-workflows.md` for complete workflows and `references/voice-synthesis.md` for voice creation options.

```
Launch flags: python main.py --listen      # defaults; optional --fp8_e4m3fn-unet for FLUX
```

- Enable tiled VAE for 8K+ upscaling
- Keep batches at 1-2× 1024×1024 and queue jobs sequentially
- Run 14B video models only quantized with offload
- Use FP8 quantization for FLUX (50% VRAM reduction)

## Workflow Generation Process

When building a workflow for a user:

1. **Clarify the goal**: Image only? Video? With voice? What's the source material?

2. **Select the pipeline pattern** from above based on requirements

3. **Generate the workflow** following node configurations in `references/workflows.md`

4. **Include model downloads** with exact filenames and paths from `references/models.md`

5. **Provide parameter recommendations** specific to their hardware/use case

## Reference Files

- `references/research-log.md` - **Latest techniques**: InfiniteYou, FLUX Kontext, PuLID Flux II, Wan 2.2 MoE, FramePack, FLUX.2, LTX-2.3, Wan 2.6, Qwen3-TTS, and more
- `references/models.md` - Complete model list with HuggingFace/Civitai links, file paths, and compatibility notes
- `references/workflows.md` - Detailed node-by-node workflow templates for each pattern
- `references/lora-training.md` - LoRA training guide with Kohya/AI-Toolkit parameters
- `references/voice-synthesis.md` - Voice cloning, TTS, and lip-sync pipeline details

## Skill Evolution

This skill is designed to evolve. When helping the user:

**Before starting a workflow:**

- Check if new models have dropped that might be better (search HuggingFace/Civitai if uncertain)
- Consider if user's past successes/failures inform the approach

**After completing a workflow:**

- Note what worked well or poorly for future reference
- If user discovers better settings, update the relevant reference file

**Proactive updates:**

- When the user mentions a new model or technique, research and integrate it
- Periodically suggest checking for updates to key dependencies

See `references/evolution.md` for monitoring sources and update protocols.

## Example: 3D Render to Photorealistic Character

For converting stylized 3D renders (like game/VN characters) to photorealistic images:

**Recommended approach:** InstantID + IP-Adapter FaceID on FLUX

```
1. Load 3D render reference (best quality, front-facing)
2. Apply InstantID (extracts identity + facial keypoints)
3. Apply IP-Adapter FaceID Plus V2 (weight 0.7)
4. Use FLUX.1-dev checkpoint
5. Prompt: "photorealistic portrait, detailed skin texture, natural lighting, [character description]"
6. CFG: 4-5, Steps: 25-30
7. FaceDetailer pass (denoise 0.35)
8. Upscale with 4x-UltraSharp
```

This converts the stylized look to photorealism while preserving the core identity features.
