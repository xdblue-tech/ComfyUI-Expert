## Update Protocol

### When New Model Drops

1. **Evaluate relevance**: Does it improve on current recommendations?
2. **Test compatibility**: Works with ComfyUI? Required nodes available?
3. **Benchmark**: Compare quality/speed vs current options
4. **Update files**:
   - `models.md`: Add download links, paths, requirements
   - `workflows.md`: Add/modify workflow if needed
   - `SKILL.md`: Update recommendation tables if it becomes new default
5. **Log change**: Add to changelog below

### When User Reports Issue

1. **Document the issue**: What workflow, what settings, what result
2. **Research solutions**: Community fixes, parameter adjustments
3. **Test fix**: Verify solution works
4. **Update relevant file**: Add troubleshooting entry or modify settings
5. **Log change**: Add to changelog

### When User Discovers Better Approach

1. **Document the discovery**: What worked better and why
2. **Validate**: Test in multiple scenarios
3. **Integrate**: Update workflows.md with new approach
4. **Promote if significant**: Update SKILL.md recommendations

## Changelog

### v1.2.0 (2026-02-18 Research Run)
**NEW MODELS:**
- **Z-Image**: Day-0 ComfyUI support (Feb 2, 2026) — non-distilled, flexible quality, NVFP4/NVFP8
- **Hunyuan 3D 3.0**: Text/image/sketch → 3D assets via Partner Nodes (Feb 16, 2026)
- **Kling 3.0**: Commercial-quality video via Partner Nodes (Feb 16, 2026)
- **Stable Video Infinity 2.0 Pro**: Infinite-length video with Wan 2.2 I2V A14B

**IDENTITY & CHARACTER:**
- **PuLID Flux Chroma**: New fork extending PuLID to FLUX + Chroma models
- **USO (ByteDance)**: FLUX.1-dev based unified style+subject generation — no more fighting the model for style fidelity
- **FLUX Kontext**: Confirmed community gold standard for single-reference consistent character editing

**PERFORMANCE (CRITICAL):**
- NVFP4 requires PyTorch cu130 — without it, NVFP4 is up to 2x SLOWER than FP8
- ComfyUI +40% on all NVIDIA GPUs (async offload + pinned memory now default)
- NVFP4 = 3x faster / 60% VRAM reduction on RTX 50 Series
- NVFP8 = 2x faster / 40% VRAM reduction (any NVIDIA GPU)
- AMD ROCm native integration: 5.4x faster for AMD GPUs

**NEW FEATURE:**
- Added `comfyui-prompt-interview` skill — conversational guided interview that synthesizes a perfect model-appropriate prompt from user answers

**FILES UPDATED:**
- `references/staleness-report.md` — first full research run logged
- `foundation/model-landscape.md` — Z-Image, SVI 2.0 Pro, Kling 3.0, Hunyuan 3D 3.0 added
- `references/research-log.md` — 2026 section appended
- `foundation/skill-registry.md` — new prompt-interview skill registered

### v1.1.0 (February 2026 Update)
**NEW MODELS & FEATURES:**
- **FLUX.2**: Up to 10 reference images for maximum identity consistency
- **LTX-2**: First production-ready open-source 4K audio+video generation
- **AuraFace**: Commercial-friendly identity encoder (ArcFace alternative)
- **F5-TTS Cross-Lingual**: Cross-lingual voice cloning without transcripts
- **DiffSwap++**: 3D latent-controlled face swapping

**PLATFORM UPDATES:**
- **ComfyUI v0.8.1**: NVFP4/NVFP8 support (3x faster, 60% VRAM reduction on RTX 50 Series)
- Native AMD ROCm integration for AMD GPUs
- Audio recording node for direct audio capture
- Weight streaming memory management

**DOCUMENTATION:**
- Added 2026 updates section to research-log.md
- Updated all model recommendation tables
- Updated Quick Decision guide with 2026 options
- Updated RTX optimization section for v0.8.1

### v1.0.0 (Initial Release)
- Core workflows: InstantID, IP-Adapter, PuLID, AnimateDiff, Wan 2.1
- Model reference with 2024-2025 state of the art
- LoRA training guide for SDXL and FLUX
- Voice synthesis covering Chatterbox, F5-TTS, RVC, ElevenLabs
- Lip-sync pipelines: Wav2Lip, SadTalker, LivePortrait

## User-Specific Learnings

Track what works best for this user's specific setup and preferences.

### Hardware Profile
- GPU: RTX 5070 Ti (16.7 GB VRAM)
- Can run: SDXL/Pony/Illustrious fully; Flux dev fp8/GGUF with offload
- Optimization: Default launch flags, sequential jobs (see `foundation/hardware-profile.md`)

### Project: Sage Character
- Source: 3D renders (visual novel style)
- Target: Photorealistic output
- Key features: Auburn hair, green eyes, freckles, fair skin
- Recommended approach: InstantID + IP-Adapter → test → train LoRA if needed

### Workflow Preferences
(To be filled as user works with skill)
- Preferred checkpoint: [TBD]
- Preferred upscaler: [TBD]
- CFG sweet spot: [TBD]
- Face detailer settings: [TBD]

### What Worked Well
