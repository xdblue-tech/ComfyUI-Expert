## Update Protocol

### When New I2V Model Releases

1. **Evaluate Relevance**
   - Does it improve on current recommendations?
   - What's the quality vs performance tradeoff?
   - VRAM requirements feasible for target users?

2. **Test Compatibility**
   - Can it be loaded in ComfyUI?
   - Required custom nodes available?
   - Works with existing workflow patterns?

3. **Benchmark Performance**
   - Test on same keyframes as existing models
   - Measure: quality, speed, VRAM usage, consistency
   - Compare to Wan 2.2, LTX-2, AnimateDiff baselines

4. **Update Documentation**
   - Add to model comparison table in SKILL.md
   - Create workflow template if significantly different
   - Document special settings or gotchas
   - Update references/i2v-workflows.md (when created)

5. **Log Change**
   - Add entry to changelog below

### When ComfyUI API Changes

1. **Review Breaking Changes**
   - Check API reference doc for affected endpoints
   - Test existing code against new version

2. **Update Code Examples**
   - Modify api-reference.md examples
   - Update Python client code
   - Test all example scripts

3. **Document Migration Path**
   - If breaking: provide migration guide
   - Note version requirements

### When User Reports Issue

1. **Reproduce & Document**
   - What workflow/settings triggered it?
   - Can it be consistently reproduced?
   - Error messages or failure mode?

2. **Research Solution**
   - Check ComfyUI issues on GitHub
   - Search community forums/Discord
   - Test potential fixes

3. **Update Documentation**
   - Add to troubleshooting section if common issue
   - Update relevant reference guide
   - Add validation check to prevent if possible

4. **Log Change**
   - Note issue and fix in changelog

## User-Specific Learnings

Track what works for specific user setups and projects.

### Hardware Profile

**User:** MCKRUZ
**GPU:** NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5070 Ti (16.7 GB VRAM)
**OS:** Linux
**ComfyUI:** 0.33.1

**Capabilities:**
- SDXL/Pony/Illustrious at full quality; Flux dev fp8/GGUF with offload
- 14B-class video models only quantized with offload, and slow
- Run video and upscaling pipelines sequentially, not simultaneously

**Optimal Settings:**
```bash
# Default launch flags (see foundation/hardware-profile.md)
python main.py --listen
# Optional for Flux workflows: --fp8_e4m3fn-unet
```

### Project: Sage Character Video Series

**Goal:** Multi-shot narrative videos (30+ seconds)
**Character:** Sage (reddish-brown hair, green eyes, fair skin)
**Style:** Photorealistic, natural lighting, intimate/sensual

**Workflow Preferences:**
- Keyframe generation: FLUX.1-dev + IP-Adapter (0.80 weight)
- I2V model: Wan 2.2 MoE 14B (film-quality aesthetics)
- Resolution: 768x1024 (portrait) or 832x1216 (larger)
- FPS: 16 (matches Wan 2.2 output)
- Transitions: 0.5s crossfade (smooth but not slow)

**What Worked:**
- ✓ Generating 5 keyframes first, validating consistency before I2V
- ✓ Using consistent motion prompts with "consistent identity, same person" prefix
- ✓ Staggering I2V submissions (3-5 minute wait between clips)
- ✓ Validating each clip immediately after generation

**What Didn't Work:**
- ✗ Submitting all 5 I2V jobs at once (overwhelmed queue)
- ✗ Using cv2.VideoWriter for concatenation (quality loss, wrong codec)
- ✗ Not validating FPS before concat (got 25fps instead of 16fps)
- ✗ Hard-coded wait times (some clips took longer, some faster)
- ✗ Manual file selection for concatenation (forgot clips 1 & 4)

**Lessons Learned:**
1. **Always validate before proceeding** - Check keyframes, then check videos
2. **Use FFmpeg, not cv2** - Better quality, proper codec support
3. **Automate everything** - Manual steps = mistakes
4. **Implement retry logic** - Some generations fail randomly
5. **Monitor ComfyUI health** - Can stall without errors
